# Godot 4.2 for Wii U

WIP port of Godot 4.2 to Wii U. 

Later releases of Godot 4.x will be eventually supported, but for now, 4.2 will be the target of this port until Godot 4 stops getting major version releases, in order to make development less of a cat-and-mouse game with upstream code changes.

This repo only contains the relevant folders to add to an existing copy of the Godot source code.

# Compiling

To compile, see [Building Godot 4.2 for Wii U](https://github.com/Homebrodot/Godot/wiki/Building-Godot-4.2-for-Nintendo-Wii-U) in the Homebrodot wiki.

Currently, this repo can be successfully compiled with the editor, and a Wii U option will appear in the export options. **However, export templates do not yet compile.**
